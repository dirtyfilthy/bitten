To get started, ensure you have the latest JDK installed and then just run "ant".

- A JAR will be placed in dist/
- JavaDocs will be placed in docs/
- Unit tests will be run

Now ensure you're running a BitCoin node locally and run the example app:

   cd out
   java com.google.bitcoin.examples.PingService

It will print a BitCoin address. If you send coins to it, you should get them back a few minutes later when a block is solved.
